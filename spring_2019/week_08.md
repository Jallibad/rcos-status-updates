## Last Week's Accomplishments

I refactored a significant amount of our code to be more readable for newcomers in the future.

## This Week's Plan

Transition our application parsing to using Shoshana's shunting yard algorithm implementation to support infix operators.  I meant to do that last week but didn't get around to it.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
