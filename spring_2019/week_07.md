## Last Week's Accomplishments

I cleaned up generated JSON from the new ExpressionWithType to match the older JSON. Also refactored most of our Haskell modules to be more sensible.

## This Week's Plan

Transition our application parsing to using Shoshana's shunting yard algorithm implementation to support infix operators.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
