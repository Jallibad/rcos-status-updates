## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I started implementing operator precedence parsing, associativity, and stuff like that.  I also worked on refactoring and a few other minor issues.

## This Week's Plan

Document code and fix operator precedence parsing.  Also get command line options for input/output working nicely.

## Anything Blocking?

I'm potentially blocking Shoshana and Ryan from continuing with their work, operator precedence stuff might not work which would complicate RPN parsing, and type outputs are complicating LLVM codegen.
