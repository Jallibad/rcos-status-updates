## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we started experimenting with LLVM code generation.  I mostly worked on refactoring the parser and type-checker.

## This Week's Plan

Extend the parser enough to allow for implementing a program that could actually run.

## Anything Blocking?

I don't have much experience working with anything that we're using.  Also Ryan and Vinny won't be able to do much more with the LLVM until I extend the language a bit further.
