## Last Week's Accomplishments

Hardcoded various things to get full support for our built-in SEQ and PRINT functions.

## This Week's Plan

Transition our application parsing to using Shoshana's shunting yard algorithm implementation to support infix operators.  I meant to do that for the last two weeks but didn't get around to it.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
