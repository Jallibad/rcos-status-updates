## Last Week's Accomplishments

I rewrote most of our types to support recursion-schemes.  Also changed our method of storing types and expressions side by side to guarantee that each "layer" in an expression has a type.

## This Week's Plan

Clean up generated JSON from the new ExpressionWithType to match the older JSON.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
