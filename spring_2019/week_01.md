## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we started planning out the syntax of the language and started distributing the tasks.  I started working on an implementation of Hindley Milner type inference.

## This Week's Plan

Get the C++ portion of the project to parse our JSON AST and compile it to LLVM IR, then use LLC to compile the IR.  Make a toolchain to call each of the parser, the runtime generator, and then LLC.

## Anything Blocking?

I don't have much experience working with anything that we're using.
