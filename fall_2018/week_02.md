##What I did

We split our group into further subgroups of two, Tommy and I together researched and discussed the relative merits/demerits of tiling in Unity for our game

##This Week's Plan

Make a decision as to whether we'll use a tiled map or something else.

##Blockers

Our lack of knowledge of Unity makes researching more difficult.
