##What I did

I started writing a set of JSON parser combinators for level loading.  This is complicated by the fact that C# is a shit language and the version that Unity supports doesn't have native tuples.

##Next Week's Plan

Get the parser combinators to the point where we can actually use them in the project.

##Blockers

C# is a shit language with relatively meager support for higher order functions, functors, sum + product types, and partial application.
