##What I did

Installed Unity, familiarized myself with the engine

##This Week's Plan

Start working on basic engine design, try and get some sprites to do anything.  Also continue nailing down the basic rules of the game and stuff like that.

##Blockers

We switched from Unreal to Unity, I have to learn a whole new engine again.
