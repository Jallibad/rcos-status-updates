##What I did

Tommy and I continued researching tiling, we decided to load things like walls and floors from JSON files containing the points.

##This Week's Plan

Now that we've decided not to use a tiled approach we have to figure out how to parse JSON files in C#

##Blockers

As always, I'm still not that familiar with Unity, if I knew best practices in Unity making resource files like this would be a lot easier.
